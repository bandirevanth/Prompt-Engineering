## 1. Introduction to Prompt Engineering

### What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the systematic craft of designing precise instructions for large language models (LLMs) to achieve domain-aligned, high-quality results in coding, analysis, modeling, and more. In modern data workflows, prompt engineering is as critical as coding or statistical acumen.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

**Core Principles:**

- **Role specification** (e.g., “act as a senior data scientist”)
- **Context and constraints** (“here is a summary table, perform cleaning…”)
- **Format and style** (“return the output as Python code with stepwise comments”)
- **Progressive refinement and example-driven prompting** (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- **Task decomposition and prompt chaining**
- **Output validation** (“explain your logic”).[^7][^2][^8][^9][^6][^10]
