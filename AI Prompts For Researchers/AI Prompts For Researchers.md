### **Key Principles for Effective AI Prompts in Research**

1. **Specificity**: Define scope, context, and desired output format (e.g., "Compare X and Y frameworks in 300 words").
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust prompts based on initial outputs (e.g., "Expand Section 3 to include case studies").
3. **Contextualization**: Provide background (e.g., "For a study targeting *Science* journal readers...").
4. **Ethical Alignment**: Verify AI-generated content for accuracy, bias, and compliance with academic standards.

By integrating these prompts into their workflow, researchers can enhance productivity, foster innovation, and navigate complex challenges with AI as a collaborative partner.
